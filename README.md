Important!
Before you can use it to turn your receiver on, you should go to the settings on your receiver's webpage (enter the IP adres in a browser), and go to settings -> Network Standby -> Select 'On'.
If you do not find these settings, take a look at this site, which might help you: http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/182663

You need to have the (local) IP-address of your receiver to add the device to Homey (There is no discovery)
